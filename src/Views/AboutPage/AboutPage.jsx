        <p>
          UMISF has been a long-standing event, spanning back to its inception
          in 2007. The tournament is carried out with the primary intention of
          providing a platform for badminton players to connect, compete, and
          hone their skills. Teams from India and Malaysia have participated in
          UMISF in 2011, marking a milestone in the history of university
          sports. For over a decade we were able to conduct this tournament
          successfully with the participation of 1000+ players in most of the
          years. After a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic and other
          unforeseen circumstances, the tournament has finally last year. In
          2023, we proudly expanded our horizons by introducing a corporate
          sector to the tournament, and we're confident that this year's event
          will be a huge success too.

        <h1>Messages From The Organizing Committee</h1>
        <p>
          Badminton has always been a popular sport among the undergraduate
          community of our university. Since the inauguration of this annual
          tournament in 2007, we have expanded our horizons. It was indeed a
          success for us to reach the 1000 plus mark in the number of
          participants. UMiSF is a great platform to show out the potential of
          youngsters, university students, university staff members, as well as
          corporates. We wish the participants the best of luck for the
          tournament and hope everyone will enjoy it.
